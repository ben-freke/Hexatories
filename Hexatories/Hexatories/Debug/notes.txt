BS:
In Territory.cpp:
setAttack/defense should be relative (eg, calling it with +10 would add 10, rather than setting it to 10)

In Actions.cpp
srand should only be called once overall, not sure if it's thread safe
All the warnings, some floats (like difference in attackTerritory) should probably be ints?
Honestly not sure if we should use threads there, we don't need to be doing anything while an attack is taking place
Also do we really want it to wait on a battle for any real amount of time? There's not going to be an animation or anything, is the sound playing not enough?
repeated code

Make methods in actions static, we don't need an instance of the class



BF:
Agree with your comments, I will:
	- Sort out variable types (e.g. float and int)
	- Call Srand once and use it to generate all random numbers

However with regard to battles:
	- My thinking was that a dialouge box with a progress bar would come up on the screen 

However, having began implementing the turn based system
	- User should find out if they have one the battle at the end of the turn

Thus:
	- Battle timings will be removed, and I will implement a FIFO Stack to run all actions at the end of a turn
	

BS:
We'll need to see actions as they happen, having them happen at the end of a turn won't work.
Eg the user could attack a territory (have no idea how many attackers they lost/if they won) and then want to reinforce it but can't until the next turn
