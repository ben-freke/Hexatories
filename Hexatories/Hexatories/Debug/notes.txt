In Territory.cpp:
setAttack/defense should be relative (eg, calling it with +10 would add 10, rather than setting it to 10)

In Actions.cpp
srand should only be called once overall, not sure if it's thread safe
All the warnings, some floats (like difference in attackTerritory) should probably be ints?
Honestly not sure if we should use threads there, we don't need to be doing anything while an attack is taking place
Also do we really want it to wait on a battle for any real amount of time? There's not going to be an animation or anything, is the sound playing not enough?
repeated code

Make methods in actions static, we don't need an instance of the class
